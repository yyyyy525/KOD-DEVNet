## Dataset
**Download Datasets**ï¼š[Baidu | Fetch code:ntd1](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=R8FytbGt7w1LpwxLUKashg&pwd=ntd1)

**TrainDataset** contains the filtered COD training data and the unified dataset constructed in this study. Since the SOD training data has not been filtered, it is not provided here.

**TestDataset** contains the KOD10K test set constructed in this study, with data sourced from the existing COD and SOD test sets.

## Results

**Evaluation.** You can download the pre-trained model weights via this [link](). Then, please update the `--pth_path` parameter in the MyTesting.py file to point to the downloaded weights, and finally run MyTesting.py to evaluate the model.

1. Performance comparison with benchmark SOD models. The best scores were marked red, followed by green and blue.
