## Dataset
**Download Datasets**ï¼š[Baidu | Fetch code:ntd1](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=R8FytbGt7w1LpwxLUKashg&pwd=ntd1)

**TrainDataset** contains the filtered COD training data and the unified dataset constructed in this study. Since the SOD training data has not been filtered, it is not provided here.

**TestDataset** contains the KOD10K test set constructed in this study, with data sourced from the existing COD and SOD test sets.

## Results

**Evaluation.** You can download the pre-trained model weights via this link: [Baidu | Fetch code: i4m9](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15OsMmxdI2w4Y1p2ynZM--Q). Then, please update the `--pth_path` parameter in the MyTesting.py file to point to the downloaded weights, and finally run MyTesting.py to evaluate the model.(The backbone weights file pvt_v2_b2.pth can be downloaded from the following link: [Baidu | Fetch code: ckx8](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1e_FaBHMgRRkUbFKc4N6Dog?pwd=ckx8).

1. Performance comparison with benchmark SOD models. The best scores were marked red, followed by green and blue.
